This repository contains code to 
1. construct blood plasma estimates for epilepsy patients using anti-seizure medication data (included in /DATA folder) and 
2. Perform analyses using these estimates to understand the relationship between anti-seizure medication levels and seizures in patients with epilepsy

To download and run data;
1. Clone repository or download onto local device
2. Maintain folders and subfolders - all individual scripts organized to run from the folder they are located in
3. Run the ‘run_all_analyses.m’ script in order to generate figures and analyses. Can run the entire script for all figures, or section by section to see individual analysis results. 

SUMMARY/OTHER NOTES:
* To generate curves and visualize seizure data for individual patients, run ‘plot_curves.m’
* To run analyses, run ‘’run_all_analyses.m’
